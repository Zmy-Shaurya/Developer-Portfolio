              Started coding a few years ago and somehow ended up here. Love building 
              React apps and Python scripts, though I probably spend more time debugging 
              than I'd like to admit.

              Currently a student but spend most of my time on side projects. My latest 
              obsession is this React based drum machine - because who doesn't 
              want to have a little fun while coding, right?
            </p>

              When I'm not staring at VS Code, I'm probably exploring new tech or 
              creating art but on a canvas instead of my VS code workspace.
