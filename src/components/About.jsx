              Started coding a couple years ago and somehow ended up here. Love building 
              React apps and Python scripts, though I probably spend more time debugging 
              than I'd like to admit.

              Currently a student but spend most of my time on side projects. My latest 
              obsession is this Solo Leveling inspired habit tracker - because who doesn't 
              want to level up in real life?

              When I'm not staring at VS Code, I'm probably exploring new tech or 
              wondering why my code worked yesterday but not today.
